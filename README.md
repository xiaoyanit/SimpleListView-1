# Android Tutorials: List View

This app is based on the android developer tutorials found here:
[*Android Developers: Hello Views*](http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/views/hello-listview.htmll) 

Initial Commit:
Built the app, replaced the hard coded COUNTRIES string by adding the data to the string.xml file as suggested.
All was quite easy, the most time consuming thing was converting the country list into XML format...

I tried to use this tool for speed, but it didn't quite work as thought, so I used Notepad++ on the result to replace all non-conforming terms...
